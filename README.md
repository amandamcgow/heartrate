# heartrate
MATLAB code I use to clean heart rate data downloaded from the Heart Graph App (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/heart-graph/id591655999). Sample data and sample output csv clean data are provided as examples.  Two MATLAB files are included because depending on the version of the App, a comma or semicolon delimiter may be used.
